What if you could see inside your AI agents? Every decision, every tool call, every dollar spent - all in real-time.

AI agents are powerful, but they're black boxes. You can't see what they're thinking, can't stop dangerous commands, and have no idea what they're costing you.

Meet the SINT Operator Dashboard - mission control for AI agents. Built in just 9 hours, this is what real-time agent observability looks like.

The Agent Registry shows all your agents at a glance. See what's running, what's connected, and health status in real-time.

In the control panel, you can chat with agents directly. But here's the magic - when an agent tries something dangerous, you get an approval gate. Review the command, edit it if needed, or deny it outright. You're always in control.

The trace viewer shows you exactly what's happening under the hood. Every agent turn, every tool call, every token spent - visualized in a hierarchical tree. Switch to timeline view to see execution flow, or filter by cost to find expensive operations.

Set guardrails with the visual policy editor. Start with pre-built templates or create custom rules. Budget limits, model whitelists, business hours restrictions - all without writing code.

Orchestrate multiple agents with the visual workflow builder. Drag and drop nodes, connect them with edges, and create complex pipelines. Choose from templates or build your own - sequential chains, parallel processing, conditional routing - it's all here.

And it's fully mobile-optimized. Native app-quality gestures, 48-pixel touch targets, and the full feature set in your pocket.

Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. 37 components, 7,000 lines of code, zero TypeScript errors. Comprehensive documentation included.
